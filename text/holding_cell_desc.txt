You move through the doorway into a dark and dingy Holding Cell.
The cells have secure reinforced bars with raggedy cots and small sinks mounted to the walls.
There's a skeleton in a tattered vault 3 uniform stretched the floor of a cell. 
Tile floors, a small office desk, and holding benches sit outside the cells.

There is a cabinet against the left wall.
The inside is mostly empty but there is a old box of Ammo in the bottom.
