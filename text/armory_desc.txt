You walk into The Armory!
A narrow and mostly ransacked arms room with a weapon table in the corner and a rack in the center of the room.
While there are bits and pieces of old weapons scattered around, you see very little of any use. 
Mostly Junk, pre-war posters, and tools.

You open the bottom of the gun rack and, to your surprise, there's still a functioning weapon that's fallen over.
Its a Combat Shotgun with no ammo inside it. But everything seems to wok fine.
