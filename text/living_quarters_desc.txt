You walk through the door and walk into the Living Quarters.
A large bay lined with bunks and dressers, foot lockers sit at the end of each bed.
Small executive suites are attached with nothing significant inside.

On a small bedside table next to a bed you see something shiny..
After a closer look you see it the Vault Key.
