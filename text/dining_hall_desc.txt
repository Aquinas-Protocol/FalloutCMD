You walk into the Dining Hall.
A brightly lit, restaurant style room with booths that line the wall and dining tables throughout.
Nuka-Cola and other pre-war posters dot the walls, small boxes of food and bottles of dirty water sit on some tables, nothing you want. 
You hear "Heartaches by the Number" playing from the juke-box at the end of the room.


In the corner one of the booths has a Helmet on the table, it looks like it will do the job.
