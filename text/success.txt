Cook-Cook shoots his flame thrower at you, your Power Armor set take it with no problem!
The few scratches you have get healed up quickly with your Stimpak!
You fire you shotgun and the blast lands, sending Cook-Cook across the room!
He's down for the count and won't be causing any more trouble.
Now you can claim your bounty and you have the key to escape the vault!
