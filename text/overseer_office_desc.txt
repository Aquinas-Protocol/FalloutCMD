You climb long sets of stairs and come to a door marked Overseer's Office.
You walk through the door and into a large, well furnished, and once luxurious office.
This penthouse style suite still has some clean functioning pre-war articles.
There is a large circular window to your left that over-looks the main Recreation Area pavilion.
You hear footsteps from a room to your right..
Cook-Cook's voice shouts "Looks like dinner came early!"
