You've found the Reactor Chamber, the heart of Vault 3!
The room itself quite large filled with massive conduits, turbines, and condensers.
All this machinery takes up almost the entire room, only a small cat walked area is walkable.

The lines and machinery all converge on the central fusion sphere.
Inside the fusion sphere, a Fusion Core seated in it's slot, small but packs a lot of power!
