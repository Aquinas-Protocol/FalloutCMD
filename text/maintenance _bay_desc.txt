You enter the dimly lit Maintenance Bay.
Dense with shelves of junk and parts, work benches and ammo crafting stations.
Large breaker arrays for the entire vault line the left wall.

On the back wall you see a large steel frame with something inside. 
As you approach you see a set of Power Armor held up by the frame.
